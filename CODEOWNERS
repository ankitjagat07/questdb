* @questdb/engineering

Explaination---
The "@questdb/engineering" appears to be a reference to a specific software library or module called "questdb/engineering". 
Based on the naming convention, it could possibly be related to the engineering aspects of a larger software project or system called "questdb".

QuestDB is an open-source, high-performance, and distributed time-series database designed for handling large-scale time-series data, 
such as financial data, IoT sensor data, and log data. The "@questdb/engineering" could be a specific module or component within the QuestDB project 
that is responsible for handling the engineering-related tasks, such as performance optimization, database schema design, query processing, indexing, and 
other technical aspects of the database system.

It's important to note that without further context or information about the specific "questdb/engineering" reference, 
it's difficult to provide a more precise explanation. It's possible that it could refer to a specific repository, package, or module within the QuestDB project,
or it could have a different meaning altogether depending on the context in which it is being used.
